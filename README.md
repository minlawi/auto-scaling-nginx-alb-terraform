# System Architecture Workflow

# Project Overview
* This mini-project demonstrates load balancing for a web server using an AWS Application Load Balancer (Internet-facing). 
* It distributes traffic across multiple instances, with an Auto Scaling Group dynamically adjusting the number of instances based on demand to improve availability and scalability.

# Deploy blue-green enviroment
Blue-Green Deployment is a software release strategy that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments‚ÄîBlue and Green.

# How It Works:
* The Blue environment is the current live version.
* A new version is deployed to the Green environment.
* Once tested and verified, traffic is switched from Blue to Green (usually via load balancer or DNS).
* If something goes wrong, rollback is as simple as redirecting traffic back to Blue.

üè¢ Real-World Example (e.g., E-commerce website)

Let's say your online store is running on Blue, version 1.0
* You develop version 1.1 with improved search
* You deploy 1.1 to Green, fully test it using staging/test data.
* Once confident, you switch live traffic to Green.
* If anything breaks‚Äîlike a payment bug‚Äîyou flip back to Blue instantly.
* Fix issues in Green, redeploy, and switch again.

# Benefits:
* Zero downtime deployments
* Easy rollback
* Environment parity (identical setups reduce "it works on my machine" issues)

# Considerations:
* Requires duplicate infrastructure (can be costly)
* Database changes need careful handling to be backward-compatible

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* Terraform ‚Äì Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool to provision and manage all AWS resources declaratively. Also used for managing Blue and Green environments as separate, reproducible stacks.
* AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) ‚Äì Internet-facing ALB used to distribute traffic across EC2 instances in both Blue and Green environments, enabling seamless traffic switching during deployments.
* AWS Auto Scaling Group (ASG) ‚Äì Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to demand for both environments, improving availability and scalability.
* AWS Launch Template ‚Äì Used to define EC2 instance configuration (AMI, instance type, user data, etc.) for Auto Scaling in both Blue and Green environments.
* Amazon EC2 ‚Äì Virtual servers to host the web application in each environment (Blue and Green).
* AWS VPC ‚Äì Virtual network for securely launching resources with subnetting and IP address management.
* Public and Private Subnets ‚Äì Isolate instances by role (e.g., web in public, app/database in private if extended).
* Route Tables and Internet Gateway ‚Äì Enable public subnet traffic routing for external access.
* NAT Gateway & Elastic IP ‚Äì Allow private instances (if used) to access the internet securely for updates.
* Bastion Host (Jumphost) ‚Äì Secure SSH access point to EC2 instances in private subnets (if applicable).
* Amazon S3 ‚Äì Stores the Terraform state file for centralized, persistent, and version-controlled state management.
* Bash Scripting (User Data) ‚Äì Automates EC2 setup and configuration tasks such as installing web servers and application code on instance launch.

# Creating the resources step-by-step
# 1. Create the AWS S3 bucket
   * git clone https://github.com/minlawi/auto-scaling-nginx-alb-terraform.git
   * cd auto-scaling-nginx-alb-terraform
   * cd s3_bucket/
   * Replace with your AWS Profile in main.tf
   * Change the bucket name in s3.tf
   * terraform init
   * terraform apply -auto-approve
   * cd ..

# 2. Create the infrastructure resources
   * Replace the bucket name in the backend block of the providers.tf file
   * terraform init

   * terraform apply -auto-approve

# Destroying the resources step-by-step

# 1. Destroy the infrastructure resources
  * terraform destroy -auto-approve
# 2. Comment-out the backend block in the providers.tf file
  * terraform init -migrate-state

# 3. Destroy the S3 bucket
  * cd s3_bucket/
  * terraform destroy -auto-approve
